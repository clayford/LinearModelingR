## Linear Modeling with R

Wed 2/19/2020  
10:00-12:00     

## Workshop description
In this workshop, weâ€™ll cover how to carry out multiple regression, ANOVA, model selection, model validation and diagnostics using the R statistical computing environment. Special emphasis will be placed on visualizing linear models to help communicate results. This workshop is ideal for those familiar with linear modeling in other programs (such as Stata or SPSS) but who want to learn how to do it in R. This can also serve as a refresher for forgotten statistics!

R is available to everyone. The only prior knowledge assumed for this workshop is basic experience using R such as how to open an R script, read in and manipulate data, and submit R code as well as some comfort with basic statistical concepts such as confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. If your stats are rusty, we recommend attending the Introductory Statistics with R workshop. Be sure to bring a laptop in order to participate.
